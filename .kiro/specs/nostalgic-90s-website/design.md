## Visual Design System

### Color Palette

Authentic 90s web colors based on early HTML standards:

- Primary Blue: `#0000ff` (classic web blue)
- Primary Red: `#ff0000` (classic web red)
- Primary Green: `#008000` (classic web green)
- Windows 95 Gray: `#cdc7bb` (system chrome)
- Background: `#ecece0` (off-white system background)

### Pixelated Structure Implementation

**Image Rendering**:

- `image-rendering: pixelated` for all bitmap graphics
- `image-rendering: crisp-edges` fallback for browser compatibility
- No image smoothing or interpolation on scaled graphics

**Typography Pixelation**:

- `text-rendering: geometricPrecision` for sharp text edges
- `font-smooth: never` and `-webkit-font-smoothing: none` to disable anti-aliasing
- Integer-only font scaling (12px, 16px, 24px) to maintain pixel boundaries

**Border and UI Elements**:

- Single-pixel borders using `border: 1px solid` with no border-radius
- Layered 1px box-shadows to create pixelated 3D effects: `box-shadow: 1px 1px 0 #000, 2px 2px 0 #666`
- Sharp rectangular shapes with no rounded corners

**Background Patterns**:

- CSS-generated dithered patterns using `repeating-linear-gradient`
- Tiled pixel patterns with `background-size: 8px 8px` for authentic bitmap textures
- Step-based gradients using `linear-gradient` with hard color stops

**Animation and Scaling**:

- Transform scale values in integer multiples only (`scale(2)`, `scale(3)`)
- Step-based animations using `animation-timing-function: steps(8, end)` for chunky movement
- Pixel-perfect positioning using integer pixel values only

**Cursor and Interactive Effects**:

- Custom pixelated cursors using 16x16 or 32x32 pixel sprites
- Chunky hover states with visible pixel transitions
- Pixelated particle effects using CSS transforms and positioned elements

### Typography

- Primary Font: Consolas, Monaco, Courier New (pixelated monospace)
- System Font: MS Sans Serif, Microsoft Sans Serif (Windows 95 UI)
- Decorative: Various period-appropriate web fonts
- Letter spacing: 0.3px for pixelated effect
- Font rendering: `text-rendering: geometricPrecision` and `font-smooth: never` for crisp edges
- Font scaling: Integer-only scaling ratios (1x, 2x, 3x) to maintain pixel boundaries

### Layout Principles

- Table-based layout structure (authentic to the era)
- Fixed-width design optimized for 800x600 resolution
- Generous use of borders, insets, and outsets
- Centered content with sidebar navigation
- Authentic Windows 95 window chrome styling

### Animation Guidelines

- Subtle blink effects for emphasis
- Marquee text scrolling
- Bouncing popup animations
- Starfield and matrix effects for easter eggs
- Frame-rate limited to maintain 90s authenticity

## Audio Integration

### Background Music System

- Winamp-style music player interface
- MIDI file support for authentic 90s web music
- Volume controls and playlist management
- Auto-play with user interaction fallback

### Sound Effects

- Dial-up modem connection sounds
- System notification beeps
- Click sounds for interactive elements
- Error sounds for system crashes

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy

- All visitor data stored locally (localStorage)
- No external tracking or analytics
- Guestbook entries remain client-side only
- No sensitive data collection

### Content Security

- All assets served from same origin
- No external script dependencies beyond fonts
- Sanitized user input in guestbook
- Safe HTML rendering for user-generated content

## Performance Optimization

### Asset Loading

- Lazy loading for non-critical components
- Optimized image formats for retro graphics
- Compressed audio files with multiple format support
- Efficient CSS bundling with Tailwind

### Runtime Performance

- Minimal JavaScript bundle size
- Efficient state management
- Optimized animation performance
- Memory leak prevention for long sessions

### Caching Strategy

- Static asset caching for images and audio
- Service worker for offline functionality
- localStorage for persistent user data
- Browser caching for CSS and JavaScript

## Deployment Architecture

### Build Configuration

- Next.js static export for Netlify deployment
- Optimized asset bundling
- Environment-specific configuration
- Build-time optimization for 90s assets

### Hosting Requirements

- Static file hosting (Netlify)
- HTTPS support for modern browsers
- CDN for global asset delivery
- Gzip compression for text assets

This design maintains the authentic 90s web experience while leveraging modern web technologies for reliability, performance, and accessibility. The component-based architecture allows for easy extension and maintenance while preserving the nostalgic charm of the early internet era.
