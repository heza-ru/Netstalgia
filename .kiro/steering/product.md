# Product Overview

**Netstalgia** is a nostalgic recreation of the 1990s internet experience built as a fully functional Next.js web application.

## Core Concept
The project authentically recreates the look, feel, and behavior of browsing the World Wide Web in the late 1990s, complete with:
- Dial-up loading screens with realistic modem simulation
- Dancing baby GIF as the centerpiece with interactive easter eggs
- Popup advertisements that behave like authentic 90s browser popups
- Windows 95-style UI elements and authentic period styling
- Interactive guestbook with localStorage persistence
- Background music player (Winamp-style interface)
- Hit counters, web rings, and other classic 90s web elements

## Target Experience
The application should feel like visiting a genuine Geocities or Angelfire homepage from 1996-1999, with:
- Authentic color palettes (not modern neon - use classic web colors)
- Period-accurate fonts and typography
- Windows 95 system styling with proper outset/inset borders
- Authentic popup behavior (some ads come back after closing)
- Classic web conventions (marquee text, blinking elements, under construction badges)

## Key Features
- **Home Page**: Dial-up loading simulation, dancing baby with triple-click easter eggs
- **Guestbook**: Sign and view entries with localStorage persistence
- **Popup System**: Automatic spawning of period-accurate advertisements
- **Easter Eggs**: Hidden features, achievement system, keyboard shortcuts
- **90s Aesthetic**: Authentic styling, animations, and UI patterns

The goal is maximum nostalgia and authenticity while using modern web technologies.
